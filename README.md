To test the planner please open  test_plannerSAT.py, replace _domain_ and _problem_ with the right paths to the pddl files, and run.

## Context 

Each team had to come up with different problems in the pddl form. The goal was to create a solver that could solve our problems and those of the other teams. 

We have decided to go along the path of SAT solvers instead of Heuristic ones because we wanted to prioritize solvability rather than speed. In fact we were confident that with small changes to our SAT algorithm we would be able to solve most problems in the context of this competition in a reasonable time. This is what led us to win the competition by all metrics : satisfiability & speed.
